# Tanathos: The Chess Engine That Probably Shouldn't Exist
> "I don't always lose to Stockfish, but when I do, I blame the eval function."

## Features
- Blazing Fast Move Generation (if you consider 2 nodes/sec "fast")
- Advanced AI (literally just if (piece == 'Q') score += 900)
- UCI Protocol Support (responds to go home with "I wish")
- 100% No Neural Nets (because I still don't know what a tensor is)
- Written in C++ because I hate myself.

## Why "Tanathos"?
- Misspelled greek name as my previous chess-related project (Sysifus).
- MIT Application Bait™ (now with 200% more bitboards).

## ⚡ Quickstart
1. **Compile** (if you dare):
```bash
xmake && xmake run
```
2. There you have, deal with it

3. **Blame the eval**
```cpp
int evaluate(ChessBoard &board) {
    return rand() % 1000; // "Stochastic optimization"
}
```

## Contributing
PRs welcome! (Disclaimer: "Welcome" ≠ "Merged")
- **Bugfixes:** Must include meme in commit message.
- **Features:** Must swear in code comments.
- **Docs:** Lol.

## MIT Application Bonus Round
> "Tanathos demonstrates my ability to ~~fail spectacularly~~ innovate under pressure. By replacing traditional evaluation with vibes, I achieved a 0% win rate against Leela Chess Zero—a groundbreaking result."
